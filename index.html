<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>coveraje is a code and test coverage tool for javascript - written in javascript.</p>
<p>It shows which instructions are executed - and how often they are executed during a test run. Thus it can be used to write proper tests, remove unused parts of your source code, and/or optimize functions that are really used often.</p>
<p>Main goal was to create coverage reports for javascript programs executed in <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node</a>. A proxy server to execute javascript in web sites is <a href="{{site.posts.whats-next.url}}" title="{{site.posts.whats-next.title}}">in work</a>.</p>
<p>coveraje uses the great <a href="https://github.com/mishoo/uglifyjs">uglifyjs</a>-parser/mangler/compressor/beautifier to parse the code and to beautify it, when needed.</p>
